**Using Source Control and CI/CD**

ServiceNow provides "Source control" functionality that allows you to integrate your applications with external version control systems like Git. This enables you to leverage the benefits of CI/CD pipelines, such as automated testing and deployment, using platforms like GitHub.

For detailed instructions on integrating ServiceNow applications with Source control and CI/CD workflows, refer to the ServiceNow documentation: [https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/tokyo-application-development/page/build/app-engine-studio/reference/source-control-operations.html](https://docs.servicenow.com/bundle/tokyo-application-development/page/build/app-engine-studio/reference/source-control-operations.html)

**Further Development**

This sample application provides a basic foundation for tracking competitor activities. You can further customize and extend it based on your specific needs. App Engine Studio offers various features to build more complex functionalities, including:

* Creating custom forms and views
* Implementing workflows and automations
* Integrating with external data sources

We encourage you to explore the capabilities of App Engine Studio to tailor Big Company Radar to your specific competitor tracking requirements.
